# HackerRank_Statistics
10 Days of Statistics project in Hacker Rank

Exercises from the practice Project 10 days of statistics in HackerRank
Resolved in R Studio. Some of them cannot be copied 1 to 1 in HackerRank and have to be modified to pass the exercise.
The most of those modifications are about STDIN and STDOUT

UPDATE:
Also the exercise sheets for Statistics for AI 01 for the BSC AI in the JKU Linz
