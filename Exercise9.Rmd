1.
A household is called prosperous if its income exceeds $100,000. A household is called educated if the householder complete college. Select an American household at random, and let A be the event that the selected household is properous and B the event that it is educated. According to a population survey it holds that P(A) is 0.138 and P(B) is 0.261.
Furthermore, the probability that a household is both prosperous and educated is 0.082.

a) What is the probability that the household selected is prosperous or educated?
b) What is the probability that a household is prosperous, given that is educated?

```{r}
cat("a)")
cat("\n")

PA <- 0.138
PB <- 0.261
PAandB <- 0.082

PAodB <- PA + PB - PAandB

cat("Probability prosperous or educated:", round(PAodB * 100, 2), "%")

cat("\n\n")
cat("b)")
cat("\n")

# P(A|B) = P(AodB) / P(B)

PAnachB <- PAandB / PB

cat("Probability prosperous given educated:", round(PAnachB * 100, 2), "%")

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
